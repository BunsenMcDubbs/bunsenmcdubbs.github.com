A couple months ago I wrote and published my first public blog post for work! It took a lot of effort to 
massage my **rough** draft into the final piece and I'm super grateful for the editing, proofreading,
and general writing tips and feedback from [Joe](https://joe.schafer.dev/), 
[Matt](https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/), and [Dan](https://twitter.com/danlovesproofs).

In the blog post, I cover ~~one of~~ my favorite data structure/algorithm, union-find! (aka disjoint-set).
I walk through the computer science-y details of the union-find and how Heap uses it to solve a unique
challenge core to our product. There's even a bit of novel-ish heuristics and some big real-world 
performance wins.

Without further ado... [Applying Textbook Data Structures for Real Life Wins](https://heap.io/blog/engineering/applying-textbook-data-structures-for-real-life-wins)
