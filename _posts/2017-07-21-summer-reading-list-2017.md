This is a living document (for the duration of the Summer 2017) to track
what I have read and what I *plan* on reading.
Yes, it is a bit late in the summer to be writing a summer reading list. But
then again, this is really more for me than for you isn&rsquo;t it?

It all started on the first day of onboarding at Square when all new-hires
received John Lewis&rsquo;s graphic novel memoir about the Civil Rights movement.
After that, I got a library card at the San Francisco Public Library and here
we are...

Although many of the books are technology and computer science focused, there
is no real concerted effort to organize a focused reading list on any topic.
This is an aspirational list, started as a subset of a longer list of books
I _eventually_ intend on reading.
I have no real intention on actually reading all of the following titles this summer.
Books and materials are added haphazardly and at anytime. Without further ado:

## Books I&rsquo;ve Read
### June - _March (Trilogy)_ by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell

I had been intending to read this graphic novel for several years but never got
around to it (and wasn&rsquo;t reading that much anyway). But then as fate
would have it, Square was distributing copies of the first book in their
onboarding process. It was a quick, gripping read and purchasing and reading
the remaining parts was a no-brainer.

### July - _Hackers and Painters_ by Paul Graham

Another long-awaited read. I read a couple of Graham&rsquo;s essays online a
while back and they really caught my attention. _Hackers and Painters_ is a
collection of essays, most/all of which have been published on
[his website](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). They cover a variety of topics including society and the nature
of technology and work. I highly recommend reading his essays, in particular:
[Beating the Average](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html), [Design and Research](http://www.paulgraham.com/desres.html), and [Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html).

I read the chapters/essays out of order but mostly came away with the following
conclusions:
 1. learn Lisp
 2. languages are very interesting (learn Lisp) and
 3. Graham is a libertarian.
 
It has inspired me to learn Racket (a Lisp).
