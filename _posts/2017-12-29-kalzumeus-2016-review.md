I&rsquo;m very excited to find this blog; it immediately falls under the
category of blogs-that-generally-cover-my-areas-of-interest-and-have-compelling-narratives-and-writing-styles-I-want-to-copy. [^1]
I also strongly agree with this point: I write for future-me to remember
what current-me thinks.

The retrospective featured well articulated career/lifestyle preferences and
rationale behind choices. On joining Stripe after an extended period of
self-employment:

>Stripe has a cultural norm, announced early and practiced often, that you’re allowed (and expected) to do the work, even if it isn’t “yours” to do based on team / title / seniority / org chart / assigned projects / etc. I love this. I have a bad case of business ADHD, and love finding novel challenges. Stripe has a huge surface area of fun problems, and solutions to them have absurd leverage. It’s like an MMORPG made out of money.

This really struck a chord with me. As HackGT 3 drew closer,
(before I became director) I was driven by this same motivation to work on
and inquire about challenges throughout the organization.
The sense of shared responsibility and opportunity motivated me throughout
the last year as director and was a large source of fulfillment. I look
forward to this sense of autonomy, responsibility, and accomplishment
in the future and especially when I start full-time at Heap.

To note: I initially found this blog through a link to his 2012 essay on
[salary negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/).
