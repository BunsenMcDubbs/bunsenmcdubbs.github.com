A last year I got particularly bored and delved into the world of generative 
art. I hacked together some admittedly crappy code in Java and got some pretty
cool results. In hindsight I realize that I probably should've used existing
frameworks such as cinder, Processing, or openFrameworks rather than build an
entirely new project.

### Fractals and Fractal Landscapes

Fractals are cool. I hacked together a fairly simplistic set of Java programs
that recursively altered lines to make interesting patterns. Due to the bad
programming, there are severe limitations on the level of detail.

Fractal landscapes use recursive processes to generate detailed and realistic
textures. [GameProgrammer.com](http://www.gameprogrammer.com/fractal.html) has a
good article on the details of the algorithms in use. Based heavily on the
recursive processes of fractals, fractal landscape algorithms add in a little
(or a lot) of randomness at each step, generating a more natural form. Here
the "heights" of each pixel/location are mapped to a color value ranging from
white to blue making cloud patterns

### 3 Dimensions!

After working in 2 dimensions, the natural next step is adding depth. Naive and
bored (a fatal combination) I set out to code a 3 dimensional visualization
with perspective. Rather than use existing libraries I decided (once a again)
to write my own code - a habit I seek to break.

I decided that I would try to rotate a wireframe cube (solving the hidden 
surface problem was beyond the scope of what I wanted to do). First was the
orthogonal view. After working out the rotation math (and discovering rotation
matrices by luck), I quickly hacked together an orthogonal 3D view. You can 
easily make a 3D mapping without perspective by just dropping the 3rd coordinate
(depth).

Perspective was much harder. You have to define a camera viewpoint in 3-space
and from there, map the 3D world onto a 2D plane that represents the computer 
screen. I did this very simply by figuring out where a line from the eye to a
point in space intersected with the plane and drawing that point on the screen.
A couple hours were devoted to manually adjusting the variables to properly size
and scale the perspective.

All the code can be found on my [Github](http://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/3DimensionalDangerzone). Soon to be documented...
