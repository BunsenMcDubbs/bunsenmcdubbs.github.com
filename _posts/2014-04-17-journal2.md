This week I continued testing and fixing some of the problems from last week as
well as adding to my main board and finalizing the code for driving. I'm pretty
much finishing as much of the work as I can before I start untethering the car.

## Main circuit board

Since soldering together the motor and servo controllers [last week]
({{ site.url }}/beaglecar/2014-04-11-journal1.html), I've been continuing to
test the circuit and finish up some components. Last time I finished the motor
controller section and soldered together the servo connections as well as the
power and ground for the IMU. This week I've added in the final components for
the limit switches (pull up resistors) as well as the data connections.

Built into this process is a constant test and debug cycle. The first
time I plugged in the circuit I actually shorted my power supply (PSU). I got
a pinching tingling feeling (electric shock) and broke the fuses in the 5v and
ground lines in the PSU. I had to replace the fuses and check for more shorts
before finishing the motor controller.

Since the indicator lights on my PSU is on a seperate circuit, I actually had 
no way of telling if the fuse was broken or if the power supply was functioning
normally. Because of this, I had to use a multimeter to read the voltage being
outputted by the 5v line on the PSU. This is what you see above. Any wild
fluctuations or sudden drops in voltage would signal a problem in the circuit.

To avoid burning up my relatively delicate Beaglebone Black with a short or
improperly wired connection, I avoided using it in the first stage of testing.
Instead, I used the PSU and a breadboard to provide the input voltages for
the motor controller. I even took the extra step of using the 3v3 line for
"data" rather than just use 5v to more closely match the Beaglebone's 3v3 data
voltages.

I've decided to leave the GPS off of the main circuit board to maintain maximum
flexibility on placement. Because I do not plan on buying an external antenna,
I might need to put the GPS chip on the top of the car or even extend it above
the top. Instead of soldering it to the board, I'm just going to leave pins to
plug in an extension cable.

Currently I'm making all the inter-circuit connections with individual hook-up
wires but in the future I plan on utilizing more organized and
professional-looking ribbon cable scavenged from old computers. I also need to
get some heat shrink tubing to protect some of the connections I've made.

## Programming - the magic behind the scenes

Now that the bulk of the code is complete, I've been moving (making copies)
the code for servo control, motor control, limit switches and teleop out of the
"test" folders. This way the files are more organized, self documenting and
easy to find.

I also finished up the ROS node for reading IMU values. The node reads from the
MPU 6050 via i2c and publishes it to a topic that later will be read in turn by
the localization/navigation node(s). Rather than publish acceleration and
rotation seperately or split by axis, I'm publishing all 6 axes of information
in the same message. This makes the code simpler and easier to manage.

One potential problem the frequency of IMU updates. Unlike the slower GPS which
runs at 1 hertz (I think I can up it to 10 hz), the IMU can run much much
faster. Although guessing arbitrary frequencies might work, I'm weary of
overloading the Beaglebone's CPU with too many updates or having too
infrequent updates cause incomplete and inaccurate data.
