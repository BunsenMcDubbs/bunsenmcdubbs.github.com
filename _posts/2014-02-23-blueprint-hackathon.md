Yesterday (Feb 22) was the [Blueprint Hackathon](http://blueprint.hackmit.org)
hosted at Google Cambridge. Team mmmYEP created _crapfinder_, a web page that
serves up amusing curated shopping results based on a how much a customer wanted
to spend.

The <del>site might go live in the future but for now it</del> <i>source code</i> lives at <a href="http://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/crapfinder">Github</a>.</del>

The site is live on [Google App Engine](http://peaceful-web-500.appspot.com).
