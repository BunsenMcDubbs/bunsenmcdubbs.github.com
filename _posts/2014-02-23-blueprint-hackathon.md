Yesterday (Feb 22) was the [Blueprint Hackathon](http://blueprint.hackmit.org)
hosted at Google Cambridge. Team mmmYEP created _crapfinder_, a web page that
serves up amusing curated shopping results based on a how much a customer wanted
to spend.

The site might go live in the future but for now it lives on [Github](http://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/crapfinder).
