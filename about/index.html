<div>
	<div class="jumbotron"><span class="big">About</span></div>

	<p class="lead">I am passionate about computer science, robotics and
	photography.</p>

	<p>I am currently at freshman at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science.
		Linux/Unix shell is my comfort zone since I alternate between a MacBook Air and
		an aging Ubuntu desktop.</p>

	<p>I have a broad interest in the field of computer science and technology in
		general. Starting with Java learned in school, I've branched out and dabbled
		in all sorts of languages and technologies. In order of familiarity, I know
		Java, Javascript, Python and I'm Haskell-curious.</p>

	<p>I've recently started learning about backend web development and working on
		the full stack with nodejs. Angular.js and Node.js are currently on my plate
		rounding out experience in web development and getting a little bit of
		everything. My previous work on the
		<a href="/beaglecar/intro.html">BeagleCar</a> had also led me to dive into
		much nitty-grittier details of computing. Next (eventually/distant future)
		on my list is a dive even deeper and playing with C/Assembly to figure out
		what really goes on in the computer (or at least a little glimpse).</p>
