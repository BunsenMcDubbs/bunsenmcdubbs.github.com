<div>
	<div class="jumbotron"><h1>Hello World!</h1><h2>This is Andrew Dai.</h2></div>


	<p class="lead">
		I am passionate about programming, robotics and photography.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Finishing up my senior year of high school, I am planning to study computer science at Georgia Tech in the fall. Linux/Unix shell is my comfort zone since I alternate between a MacBook Air and an aging Ubuntu desktop.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Aside from an introductory course (taught in Java) I am entirely self taught in computer science. In order of familiarity, I know Java, Python, Javascript, PHP and I'm Haskell-curious. In the near future I plan on cozying up to more web technologies like AJAX and developing more web-based applications. My current work with the <a href="/beaglecar/intro.html">BeagleCar</a> has also led me to dive into much nitty-grittier details of computing.
