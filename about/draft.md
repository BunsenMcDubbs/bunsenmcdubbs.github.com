I am studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Hailing from the suburbs of Boston, I also consider the &rquo;nix shell my home.
When away from keyboard, I love traveling and hiking with my camera.

At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in collaboration
with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana,

I am a student, tinkerer, nerd, hackathon hacker, and photographer. Hailing from
quiet suburbs outside Boston, I&rquo;ve fulfilled my dreams of becoming a
carpetbagger by moving down South to Atlanta to study computer science at
the Georgia Institute of Technology.

A true nerd at heart, I am now studying computer science at the
Georgia Institute of Technology.
