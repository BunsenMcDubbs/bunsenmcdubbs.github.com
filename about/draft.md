I am studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Hailing from the suburbs of Boston, I also consider the &rquo;nix shell my home.
When away from keyboard, I love traveling and hiking with my camera.

I am a student, tinkerer, nerd, hackathon hacker, and photographer. Hailing from
quiet suburbs outside Boston, I&rsquo;ve fulfilled my dreams of becoming a
carpetbagger by moving down South to Atlanta to study computer science at
the Georgia Institute of Technology.

A true nerd at heart, I am now studying computer science at the
Georgia Institute of Technology.



I like to code, photograph, travel and write (ordered from
most to least frequent). Most of the time you can find me
either listening to my Magic Man Pandora station or podcasts
heavily featuring NPR. Away from the keyboard, I enjoy being
outside and enjoying nature.


This summer I&rsquo;m interning at Intersystems in Cambridge.
At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in collaboration
with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana, I developed a multitouch
version of the Dust and Magnet data visualization.
