        I&rsquo;ve completed several software engineering internships in the
        past couple years. Summer 2016 brought me to Washington DC for a
        internship with Applied Predictive Technologies. I had the pleasure
        of working with two teams over the course of the summer, developing both
        core intrastructure code and working on new growth products.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        This past summer I interned at Intersystems in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
        Working with two other interns and a mentor, my team and I developed
        and shipped a new web interface and API for the legacy bug and feature
        tracking software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, I&rsquo;ve interned at the Concord Consortium, where I
        helped develop and test various educational software and web apps. I
        have also helped create prototype devices for MRI imaging at the
        Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital
        and coached for my local town swim team.

        At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in
        collaboration with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana, I
        developed a multitouch version of the Dust and Magnet data
        visualization. It is built with Processing and Java and heavily
        utilizes the Simple Multitouch Library. A poster was presented at
        IEEE Vis 2016 and an accompanying presentation is available
        <a href="http://andrewdai.co/dustandmagnet-presentation/">online</a>.

        I am currently working on a larger scale, full-stack web application for
        visualizing complex, rich data in a collaborative,
        multi-user/multi-device environment. It is primarily written in
        Javascript with a Node.js stack backed with MySQL and Elasticsearch.
        The project is available on my
        <a href="https://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/congressvis">Github</a>.

        After a brief stint in Canada, I grew up in the quiet suburbs of Boston.
        This is where I formed my love of both photography and computer science
        as well as solidifed my immunity to and love of cold weather.

        With my fair share of winters behind me, I decided to enjoy some
