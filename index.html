          I am a student, curious tinkerer, hackathon hacker, and
          avid photographer. A true nerd at heart, I am now studying
          computer science at the

          <p>This summer I&rsquo;m interning at Intersystems in Cambridge.
            In the past, I&rsquo;ve also interned at the Concord Consortium

          <p> At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in
            collaboration with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana, I
            developed a multitouch version of the Dust and Magnet data
            visualization. It is built with Processing and Java and heavily
            utilizes the Simple Multitouch Library.</p>

            Although born farther north and closet Canadian, I
            grew up in the quiet suburbs of Boston. This is where I formed my
            love of both photography and computer science as well as solidifed
            my immunity to cold weather.

            After living in Massachusetts and getting closely
            aquainted with that famous New England charm, I decided to experience
            my share of Southern Hospitality. I moved down South to attend school
            and live out my dream of becoming a carpetbagger.
