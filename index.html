        This past summer I interned at Intersystems in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
        Working with two other interns and a mentor, my team and I developed
        and shipped a new web interface and API for the legacy bug and feature
        tracking software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, I&rsquo;ve interned at the Concord Consortium, where I
        helped develop and test various educational software and web apps. I
        have also helped create prototype devices for MRI imaging at the
        Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital
        and coached for my local town swim team.

        At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in
        collaboration with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana, I
        developed a multitouch version of the Dust and Magnet data
        visualization. It is built with Processing and Java and heavily
        utilizes the Simple Multitouch Library. A poster was presented at
        IEEE Vis 2016 and an accompanying presentation is available
        <a href="http://andrewdai.co/dustandmagnet-presentation/">online</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on a larger scale, full-stack web application for
        visualizing complex, rich data in a collaborative,
        multi-user/multi-device environment. It is primarily written in
        Javascript with a Node.js stack backed with MySQL and Elasticsearch.
        The project is available on my
        <a href="https://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/congressvis">Github</a>.

  <p>I have a broad interest in the field of computer science.
    Starting with Java learned in school, I&rsquo;ve branched out and
    dabbled in all sorts of languages and technologies.</p>
  <p>In order of familiarity, I know Java, Javascript (full stack with
    Node.js and Express.js), Python and I am also Haskell-curious.
    I have also extensively used Processing in Java and I am proficient
    in a *nix environment.</p>

        Although born even farther north as a closet Canadian, I
        grew up in the quiet suburbs of Boston. This is where I formed my
        love of both photography and computer science as well as solidifed
        my immunity to cold weather.

        With my fair share of winters behind me, I decided to enjoy some
        fairer weather. I moved down South to attend
        school and live out my dream of becoming a carpetbagger.
