          I am a student, curious tinkerer, hackathon hacker, and
          avid photographer. A true nerd at heart, I am now studying
          computer science at the

          <p> At Georgia Tech, under the direction of Dr. John Stasko and in
            collaboration with PhD students Chad Stopler and Ramik Sadana, I
            developed a multitouch version of the Dust and Magnet data
            visualization. It is built with Processing and Java and heavily
            utilizes the Simple Multitouch Library.</p>

    <p>I have a broad interest in the field of computer science.
      Starting with Java learned in school, I&rsquo;ve branched out and
      dabbled in all sorts of languages and technologies.</p>
    <p>In order of familiarity, I know Java, Javascript (full stack with
      Node.js and Express.js), Python and I am also Haskell-curious.
      I have also extensively used Processing in Java and I am proficient
      in a *nix environment.</p>

          Although born farther north and closet Canadian, I
          grew up in the quiet suburbs of Boston. This is where I formed my
          love of both photography and computer science as well as solidifed
          my immunity to cold weather.

            After living in Massachusetts and getting closely
            aquainted with that famous New England charm, I decided to experience
            my share of Southern Hospitality. I moved down South to attend school
            and live out my dream of becoming a carpetbagger.

    <p id="more-info">I like to code, photograph, travel and write (ordered
      from most to least frequent). Most of the time you can find me
      either listening to my Magic Man Pandora station or podcasts
      heavily featuring NPR. Away from the keyboard, I am often
      outside and enjoying nature.
