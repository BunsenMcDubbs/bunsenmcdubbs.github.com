# This is my website, v3.0ish

It's built with Atom, Vim, and Git on top of Jekyll, jQuery and PureCSS.
The site is also constantly on the brink of being changed because I am never
happy with the design.

## Typography

 - FontAwesome is used for the icons on the home page.
 - Open Sans and Merriweather are hosted on Google Fonts.
 - Main title
   - League Gothic is used for the main titles.
   - [slabText](http://freqdec.github.io/slabText/) for resizing

## Blog Posts

 - [Lede paragraph style](https://github.com/BunsenMcDubbs/bunsenmcdubbs.github.io/blob/master/css/post.css#L53-L59) modified from Bootstrap
 - Blog posts page uses PureCSS to set up grid styles
 - Table of Contents
   - automatically generated by [TOC jQuery plugin](http://projects.jga.me/toc/)
   - fancy positioning with the [sticky jQuery plugin](http://stickyjs.com)
   - dynamically load and execute plugins depending on whether or not the posts actually have any headings - modified from [sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/dynamically-load-jquery-library-javascript/)
