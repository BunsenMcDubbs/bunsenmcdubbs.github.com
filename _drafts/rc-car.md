This entire tutorial/post can be skipped with the use of a hobby-grade RC Car.
They can easily be identified by either the price tag or high quality
interchangable parts in the car itself. The mods outlined here are to upgrade
cheaper toy-grade RC cars to resemble the functionality of their hobby-grade
counterparts.

# Choosing a car

In my experience, it is far easier to use a smaller or regular sized RC car
rather than the enormous (1:6 scale+) toys. The larger toys are both more
expensive (especially when it inevitably breaks), less convenient to tear
apart and harder to modify. My main concern was hacking together the motor
controller. In smaller cars (powered by AA's) the voltages are much smaller and
the controllers are made from transistors and smaller voltage componenents
(read: cheaper and easier). Larger toys have relays which, in addition to being
slightly more difficult to control, switch slower than transistors. This makes
speed control far more inaccurate/difficult since it depends on a rapid
on/off cycle to mix speeds (aka PWM - pulse width modulated signal).

# Tearing Apart the Car

Pretty self explanatory. Take off the fluff and outer shells. Keep the
electronics in place (for now). Get to the core ("chassis") of the toy.
Locate the major components (and seperate if desired).

# Modifications

There are several moddifications necesary to emulate the driving functionality
of a real car. First, as mentioned above, is a speed/motor controller. This way
the toy has more speeds than just 100% forwards, 100% backwards and neutral.
Similarly, a servo-based steering control replaces the binary left-right
steering on the toy and allows for (gasp) intermediate turning angles.
