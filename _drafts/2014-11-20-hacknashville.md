In late October we saw a post on the GTHackers group on Facebook promoting
HackNashville. Almost as a spur of the moment decision, we all signed up and
less than a month later we were on a van to Nashville.

## The Idea

We came with an concept for a light-hearted web app that faciliated (friendly)
competition. It's simple. Integrate an everyday part of life more seamlessly
with web technologies and social media.

 1. First take an embarrassing pic(ture). A picture that you don't
want to be shared with your social network or the public as a
whole.

 2. Then pick your wager. Get a group of your friends and make a
bet, a game or some type of contest. There must be one
identifiable loser and they will suffer the consequences.

 3. Now you are stuck in a Pickl(e). No one can back out of this
commitment. once the picture has been uploaded to our servers
and the clock ticking, there can be no quitting or flaking.
Someone must lose.

## Implementation

The web app called for a full stack Node.js application.
We used Drywall, a boilerplate that used Express.js,
Passport.js, Mongoose and more.

### Which Framework?

We had dabbled with Node.js and Express in the past making one
or two projects. This was by far our most ambitious endeavor.
Our app called for a full stack with a database, interfacing
with other API's (Facebook and Imgur). The three of us all have
a bunch of experience programming but we'd soon learn that this
project was a bit over our heads.

First up was the question of which framework? Knowing that we
wanted to use Node simplified the search quite a bit but there
was still quick a selection. In the end, (after an enormous
amount of trial and error... mostly error) we settled on
Drywall. Based on Node and Express, it implements most of the
social media and user management tools that we needed to pull
off our app.

### Getting to work

Even though we found an excellent foundation for our work, it
was not smooth sailing to our final product.
We encountered quite a few hiccups, false starts and a backward
step or two throughout the process.
Overall it was definitely a learning process and topics were
more challenging than others.
