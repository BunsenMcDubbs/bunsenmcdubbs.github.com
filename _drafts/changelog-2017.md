Short-form, semi-structured thoughts and observations about the past year.
A sort of second attempt/follow-up to [Reflection on 2017]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-19-2017-reflection %}).

## This website (andrewdai.co)

- Pushed [20 commits to update my resume](https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/bunsenmcdubbs.github.io/commits/master/resume)
- Added [GitHub and Instagram feeds to homepage](https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/bunsenmcdubbs.github.io/issues/5)
- Added quote post-type (see [recent]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-28-nytimes-year-in-pictures %}) [examples]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-29-kalzumeus-2016-review %}))
- [Updated to Jekyll 3](https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/bunsenmcdubbs.github.io/commit/928c108ea9be7407538328df5849eab46386931b)
  - Fixed ruby install on my computer *fingers crossed*
- Figured out [how to use footnotes](https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/bunsenmcdubbs.github.io/commit/1a23efdbae5c22463481236483da478f703f3be2) (after updating Jekyll)
- Wrote and posted more blog posts than 2016 and 2015 (this is an incredibly low bar)

## Me IRL

- Lifestyle creep
  - Higher income, ready to graduate, interning/living in San Francisco
  - Starting paying (or almost paying) for subscription services - NYTimes (student discount), Spotify/Hulu (student package), Amazon Prime (trial)
  - Going out to more restaurants, bars (incidentally, I also turned 21)
  - Started buying (more) stuff - new wallet, phone, clothes, shoes, (fun!) socks, Sony Studio monitor headphones (following last year's purchase of mechanical keyboard)
- [Finished semester #7, one more semester to go](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcsjI8SHTDI/?taken-by=bunsenmcdubbs), May 2018 is coming up fast
- Increased content creation (questionable accuracy, very anectodal)
  - More Instagram posts
  - Trying to (and actually) writing more, especially on this blog, also in my notebooks etc.
- Lived on the West Coast - saw a lot, learned a lot, had a ton of fun, met amazing new people.
- HackGT!
  - It happened! No one died!
  - There is so much more to say here. It was an incredibly rewarding, painful, wonderful learning and growing experience. There are also some pretty epic fails, huge achievements, and lingering regrets that all deserve some attention (probably in another place at another time).
- Other accomplishments/events/things:
  - Finished job search, signed offer, excited for the future
    - Total X interviews with X companies
  - Interned at Square, lived in SF
    - Learn[ed\|ing] to use emacs (spacemacs) - thanks rudle!
  - Controlled descent down the GPA slope still good

## (Near) Future: Goals, Exciting Plans

- [Give back](https://80000hours.org/) and contribute meaningfully to society (in a professional capacity and otherwise)
- (Continued) lifestyle improvements
  - Better sleep schedule (failing horrifically right now - being home on break isn&rsquo;t helping)
  - Continued regular running - training for Publix Half Marathon in March(?!)
  - More vegetable-centered cooking (after all, I am moving to California soon), batch cooking
- Technical goals
  - Learning more low-level/systems _stuff_ (slowly writing bad RDBMS or shitty cryptocurrency in Rust)
  - Improve emacs/spacemacs skills and customization ability (Lisp?!) [^1]
  - Start some long-term personal projects. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about several of these recently - all centered around the idea of owning your own personal data. They include:
    - DIY/self-hosted IoT, because [IoT is a security nightmare](https://www.google.com/search?q=iot+security+breach), a data goldmine for vendors, and kind-of a meme. Also because a lot of the projects are [pretty cool](http://www.instructables.com/id/Uber-Home-Automation-w-Arduino-Pi/) and [simple](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Magic-Mirror/).
    - Some self-hosted ~CMS software that makes it slightly easier to publish to Jekyll
    - Lifelogging data capture, analytics, visualization (a vastly inferior version of the [Feltron Annual Report](simi))
  - Flex some social science and data science skills? I want to build something with liberal usage of Jupyter Notebooks similar to my (incomplete) [paper replication project](https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/cs8803-replication-project) for this past fall&rsquo;s [Computational Social Science class](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-css-class). [^2]
- Read more! (super cliche)
  - Learn more about art!
  - and many other things
  - Also read intentionally with the goal of improving my writing
- [Buy](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/cta?query=bmw+e36+m3&sort=rel) [a](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/cta?query=mustang&sort=rel) [project](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/250x250/74689026/when-you-own-a-project-car-and-its-a-daily-driver.jpg) [car](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/cta?query=miata&sort=rel)?!
- Travel! In order of decreasing immediacy:
  - Explore Atlanta
  - Explore [nearby](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-nashville.html) [areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/travel/36-hours-new-orleans.html) [in](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/11/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-houston.html) [the](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/04/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-austin-texas.html) [South (roadtrip?)](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Atlanta,+GA/New+Orleans,+LA/Houston,+Texas/Austin,+TX/@31.4214195,-100.0946752,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m26!4m25!1m5!1m1!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!2m2!1d-84.3879824!2d33.7489954!1m5!1m1!1s0x8620a454b2118265:0xdb065be85e22d3b4!2m2!1d-90.0715323!2d29.9510658!1m5!1m1!1s0x8640b8b4488d8501:0xca0d02def365053b!2m2!1d-95.3698028!2d29.7604267!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644b599a0cc032f:0x5d9b464bd469d57a!2m2!1d-97.7430608!2d30.267153!3e0)
  - Post-graduation travel to Europe (actively soliciting suggestions)
  - ??? on the West Coast after relocating to San Francisco in July
    - Roadtrips with aforementioned car
    - Take the [Coast Starlight](http://blog.amtrak.com/2017/03/this-is-west-coast/) to Seattle
- Continue to write more - hopefully Changelog 2018 exists and is in a long-form essay format
  - This, combined with data and pretty visualizations from lifelogging could create an interesting project. I recently re-discovered that I&rsquo;ve had [Google Location History](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline) enabled since I got my first Android phone right before I started college. \<insert idea for interesting college retrospective here\>

2018 will be an interesting year of new experiences, transitions, and the start of life-after-school.
Here&rsquo;s to hoping that I write some of it down.

[^1]: I read _Hackers and Painters_ this summer and my main lesson-learned was that I [should learn Lisp]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-07-21-summer-reading-list-2017 %})

[^2]: Coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve also noticed that a not-insignificant number of winning hackathon projects are just implementations of research papers.
