<h1>The BeagleCar</h1>
<p>written on 1/5/2014</p>
<h2>An Autonomous RC Car Controlled by a Beaglebone Black</h2>
<p>I'm making a self driving RC car for my senior project. It will be guided by
GPS waypoints and utilize GPS data as well as inertial movement readings to
accurately localize itself. I am also currently toying with the idea of
cameras and distance sensors so the car/robot won't be so "blind". But that is
a stretch goal far beyond my current capacities (need to get the car to move
first).</p>
<p>My previous (brief) experience with Arduino equipped me with a false sense of
confidence when I bought a Beaglebone Black and started my project. Embedded
Linux is something I have absolutely no experience with; but regardless, time
for the fun to begin.</p>
<p>For the project I have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">Beaglebone Black</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11028">Sparkfun's MPU-6050 Breakout Board</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/746">Adafruit "Ultimate" GPS Breakout</a></li>
<li>and a used toy RC Car</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this project is inspired by <a href="http://www.transistor.io/tag/autonomous-car.html">Jason Dorweiler's Autonomous
Car</a>.</p>
<h2>Gameplan (rough and semi-overlapping)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="part1.html"><em>Get the sensors working with the BBB.</em></a> I want to be able to get proper readings as well as play with some of the extra features of the two sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Set up ROS.</em> I want to use <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS (Robot Operating System)</a> to handle all the scafolding for the "brains" of the car. Also there are some nice testing tools that I don't have to write myself... hopefully this will save me time in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Navigation, localization and driving algorithms.</em> Use Kalman Filter, dead reckoning and PID control to let the robot figure out where it is going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Get a toy RC car and modify it.</em> The steering in toy-grade RC cars is often just a motor that goes hard-left or hard-right, replacing it with a servo will give me much more control over the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integrate sensors, navigation/planning algorithms, and driving interface into ROS.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tune PID</em> and...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe even have cameras and distance sensors to give the robot "eyes" and do obstacle avoidance...</p>
</li>
